# pypolybuilder


## The construction of a molecular topology file is a prerequisite for any classical molecular dynamics simulation. However, the generation of such a file may be very challenging at times, especially for large supramolecules. While many tools are available to provide topologies for large proteins and other biomolecules, the scientific community researching nonbiological systems is not equally well equipped. Here, we present a practical tool to generate topologies for arbitrary supramolecules: The pyPolyBuilder. In addition to linear polymer chains, it also provides the possibility to generate topologies of arbitrary, large, branched molecules, such as, e.g., dendrimers. Furthermore, it also generates reasonable starting structures for simulations of these molecules. pyPolyBuilder is a standalone command-line tool implemented in python. Therefore, it may be easily incorporated in persisting simulation pipelines on any operating systems and with different simulation engines.
